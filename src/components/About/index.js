      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        A full-stack web developer with a Master's level education in Social
        Work. I Recently earned a certificate in full-stack development from the
        University of Texas at Austin, with newly developed skills in
        JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design. With each project,
        I aim to facilitate the user's engagement with software that is easily
        accessible and optimal to increase user satisfaction. During my time in
        the Bootcamp, I was able to learn and have hands-on experience in
        creating dynamic web applications that are following pace with industry
        standards. Iâ€™m excited to leverage my skills as part of a fast-paced,
        quality-driven team to build better experiences on the web.
